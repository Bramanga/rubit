# Rubit
### A stupid simple ruby html server

License: MIT - Do what you will, for science.

### Abstract

Rubit is a bare bones, built from the ground up, overnight ruby html server. As of the righting of this README, it still needs to be able to terminate its requests properly.

### Development Plan

1. Fix request handling and add proper termination.
2. Add support for other http requests (ie: POST, DELETE, etc.)
3. Add stupid simple caching, or rather, pseudo caching.
4. Anything else you see fit.

**This is really a night project. I wanted to see if I could make a multithreaded ruby server in one sitting.**
